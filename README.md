# Barcode Creator
### I need bar codes to scan!

And that is the truth. I'm working on a different project where I realized that I needed unique barcodes. I found 
python-barcode and decided to make my own barcode creator. 

It was fun to make and has all the features I need for my other project. If you need EAN13 barcodes or a base to build
your own barcode creator, feel free to clone and have fun.
